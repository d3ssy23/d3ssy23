### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Dessy,

**Audio Engineer | Audio developer | JUCE | C/C++ Developer | DSP & Embedded Systems Enthusiast**

Iâ€™m an **audio engineer, developer, and digital nomad** passionate about all kinds of audio technologies.  
I build **audio plugins**, explore **DSP**, and share what I learn along the way.  

If youâ€™re into **audio development**, **sound design**, or **plugin creation**, Iâ€™d love to connect â€” whether itâ€™s for a collaboration, a project, or just to chat about sound and code.  

ðŸ“« Reach me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/desislava-ilieva-482747158/).
